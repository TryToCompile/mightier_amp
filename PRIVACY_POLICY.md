# Privacy Policy

I (Diyan Iliev) built the Mightier Amp app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by me at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Mightier Amp unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
## Data Collection
Mightier Amp app does not collect any personal data from its users. The only data that is collected is for diagnostics and error reporting purposes. This data is collected anonymously and is used to improve the app's performance and user experience. The data is collected using a third-party service called Sentry, which has its own privacy policy.
## Third-Party Services
Mightier Amp uses the Sentry service for diagnostics and error reporting. When an error occurs, the app sends anonymous diagnostic information to Sentry. This information may include device information, operating system version, and other technical data. Sentry's privacy policy can be found [here](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

## Changes to This Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If I make any material changes to how the data is collected, used, or shared, I will reflect the changes on this page.
